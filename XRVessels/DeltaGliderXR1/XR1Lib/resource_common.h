// ==============================================================
// XR1 Base Class Library
// These classes extend and use the XR Framework classes
//
// resource_common.h
// Defines resource IDs that must be common between the XR1 and all
// subclasses.  In order for this to work with Visual Studio's 
// resource editor, you must manually add these #define values
// to your project's resource.h file: including it will not work
// because resource.h and foo.rc are both regenerated each time
// the dialog is saved from the editor, and '#include' lines are not
// preserved.
